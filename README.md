# 📉 Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

This project aims to predict customer churn in the telecom industry using machine learning. Identifying customers who are likely to leave the service helps companies retain them through targeted offers and support.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Telecom companies face significant losses due to customer churn. Predicting which customers are likely to leave allows the company to take proactive measures and reduce churn rates.
